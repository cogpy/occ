# Guix Build Hanging Issue - Fixed

**Date:** 2025-10-22 (Updated: 2025-10-24)  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (Updated with complete removal)

## Problem

The Guix build workflow was hanging indefinitely during the channel update phase with output like:

```
building CA certificate bundle...
listing Emacs sub-directories...
building fonts directory...
building directory of Info manuals...
building profile with 1 package...
hint: Consider installing the `glibc-locales' package and defining
`GUIX_LOCPATH', along these lines:
     guix install glibc-locales
     export GUIX_LOCPATH="$HOME/.guix-profile/lib/locale"
See the "Application Setup" section in the manual, for more info.
Updating channel 'guix' from Git repository at 'https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git'...
```

The process would hang at the "Updating channel..." step and never complete, causing CI builds to time out after the workflow's 60-minute limit.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred in the "Update Guix channels and profile" step of `.github/workflows/guix-build.yml`:

1. **Network Operations Without Timeout**: The `guix pull` command fetches updates from the remote Git repository at `https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git`. This network operation had no timeout mechanism, allowing it to hang indefinitely if:
   - The network connection was slow or unstable
   - The Git server was experiencing issues
   - The download was interrupted but not properly terminated

2. **No Fallback Mechanism**: The workflow treated `guix pull` as a critical operation, but it's actually optional for most builds since the fresh Guix installation already includes the necessary modules.

3. **Resource Intensive Operations**: Without limiting parallel jobs, `guix pull` could consume excessive resources, further slowing down the process.

## Solution History

### Initial Fix (2025-10-22)
Added timeout protection and graceful degradation to prevent indefinite hanging with timeouts on `guix pull`, `glibc-locales`, and `guix package -u`.

### Final Fix (2025-10-24) - Complete Removal
**Even with timeouts, the update step was still causing issues and preventing the main build from running.**

The entire "Update Guix channels and profile" step has been **completely removed** from `.github/workflows/guix-build.yml`.

#### What was removed:
- `guix install glibc-locales` (with 5-minute timeout)
- `guix pull --max-jobs=2 --fallback` (with 10-minute timeout)
- `guix package -u` (with 5-minute timeout)
- All profile sourcing and GUIX_LOCPATH setup related to updates

#### Why this works:
- The fresh Guix installation already includes all necessary modules for the build
- The workflow proceeds directly from "Setup Guix environment" to "Verify Guix files"
- No network-dependent update operations that can hang or timeout
- Faster CI builds since no time is spent on updates

## Impact

These changes ensure that:

1. **No Hanging**: The problematic update step is completely removed
2. **Faster Builds**: No time wasted on network-dependent update operations
3. **Reliable CI**: Workflow always completes successfully without network-related failures
4. **Acceptable Builds**: The fresh Guix installation includes all necessary modules for building

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. The workflow should complete within the 60-minute timeout
2. No update operations should occur - workflow goes directly to verification and build
3. The build steps should execute using the fresh Guix installation
4. No network-related hanging or timeout messages

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Add timeouts to update operations** (Previous approach): Still caused issues with timeouts
2. **Use substitutes only**: Faster, but may not always be available
3. **Cache Guix installation**: Complex to implement in GitHub Actions
4. **Longer timeouts**: Would still risk hanging, just for longer
5. **Complete removal** (Current approach): Most reliable, uses fresh installation which already has needed modules

The chosen approach prioritizes reliability (will never hang) and focuses on getting the main build working first.

- `GUIX_CI_MODULE_FIX.md` - Module availability fixes
- `.guix/README.md` - Guix usage documentation

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements (if channel updates are needed later):

1. **Cache mechanism**: Cache Guix channels between runs
2. **Conditional updates**: Only update on schedule, not every build  
3. **Separate workflow**: Have a dedicated workflow for updating Guix, separate from builds
4. **Network diagnostics**: Check connectivity before attempting updates

For now, the focus is on getting the main build working reliably.

## Verification

The workflow should now show a clean progression:

```bash
# Setup steps
Install GNU Guix non-interactively (SSR safe)
Setup Guix environment
# Then directly to:
Verify Guix files
Build with Guix (dry-run)
Build with Guix (actual build - may be slow)
```

No update-related output or timeout warnings should appear.

The key success criterion is that the workflow **completes successfully** and the main build runs without hanging.

## Summary

✅ **Problem**: `guix pull` and update operations hanging/timing out, preventing main build  
✅ **Solution**: Completely removed the "Update Guix channels and profile" step  
✅ **Impact**: Workflow can no longer hang on updates  
✅ **Trade-off**: No channel updates, but fresh installation has all needed modules  
✅ **Result**: Reliable CI builds that focus on the main build process
