# Contributing to the OpenCog Collection

We welcome contributions from everyone! This document provides some guidelines for contributing to the OpenCog Collection (OCC).

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the OCC, including:

-   **Reporting bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/opencog/occ/issues).
-   **Suggesting enhancements:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it.
-   **Writing documentation:** We are always looking for help to improve our documentation. If you see something that is unclear or incomplete, please let us know.
-   **Writing code:** If you want to contribute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
    build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
    variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the README.md to the new version that this
    Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
    do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
