## The Third Order Cybernetics of Eric Schwarz and Maurice Yolles

This comprehensive academic document explores Eric Schwarz's pioneering work in third-order cybernetics and presents a holistic metamodel for understanding self-organizing systems across physical, biological, social, and cognitive domains.[^1]

### Historical Context and Significance

Eric Schwarz (1931-2015) was a professor emeritus at the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, where he directed the Interdisciplinary Centre for Systemic Studies (CIES), founded in 1988. He produced the first explicitly third-order cybernetic model in 1988, marking a significant advancement in cybernetics beyond the first and second-order approaches. His extensive work—comprising 21 papers on his paradigm—has been partially preserved and compiled by Maurice Yolles due to limited accessibility of conference publications.[^1]

### The Holistic Metamodel Foundation

Schwarz's central contribution lies in proposing a **non-dualist, non-mechanist metamodel** that transcends the Cartesian-Newtonian framework. Rather than viewing reality as objects moving in space-time according to permanent laws, his approach conceptualizes the world as networks of interconnected systems composed of:[^1]

1. **Physical plane (energy)**: Objects and material components
2. **Information plane (relations)**: Networks of potential and actual relations
3. **Existential plane (being)**: Emerging wholeness that subsumes both objects and relations[^1]

This triadic structure represents the most fundamental entity—a minimal system consisting of two interacting components producing an emergent whole.[^1]

### Six Cycles of Viable Systems

Schwarz identifies six cycles that characterize complex, viable self-organizing systems:[^1]

**Stabilizing cycles (enabling persistence):**

- **Vortices (1)**: Physical recycling of matter and energy—metabolic processes
- **Homeostasis (3)**: Functional feedback loops maintaining regulation
- **Self-reference (5)**: Existential autonomy and self-knowledge

**Creative cycles (enabling change and adaptation):**

- **Morphogenesis (2)**: Self-organization creating new structures
- **Autopoiesis (4)**: Self-production of living systems
- **Autogenesis (6)**: Self-creation leading to autonomy

These cycles operate across three ontological planes, with horizontal cycles providing stability within each plane and vertical cycles enabling transformation across planes.[^1]

### The Spiral of Self-Organization

The metamodel describes system dynamics through a spiral pattern representing four successive phases:[^1]

0. **Entropic drift**: Non-linear conditions far from equilibrium following system decay
1. **Morphogenesis**: Differentiation triggered by positive feedback loops
2. **Communication**: Fluxes between differentiated structures establishing networks
3. **Cybernetics**: Causal networks influencing subsequent development
4. **Autopoiesis**: Self-productive cycle emergence
5. **Self-reference**: Increased recursivity where machine and image converge
6. **Autonomy**: System actualization according to its own rules

### Streams of Systems Thought

Schwarz's 1996 visualization "Streams of Systems Thought," later elaborated in 2000-2001 for the International Institute for General Systems Studies, contains approximately 1,000 nodes representing interconnected ideas and theorists. The map uses 12 colors to distinguish conceptual domains: general systems, cybernetics, physical sciences, mathematics, computers and informatics, biology and medicine, symbolic systems, social systems, ecology, philosophy, systems analysis, and engineering.[^1]

### From Epistemology to Action

In his 2005 paper "From Epistemology to Action," Schwarz articulates principles for intervening in complex systems based on understanding their natural dynamics. He identifies 12 leverage points adapted from Donella Meadows' framework:[^1]

**Physical plane interventions:**

- Constants, parameters, and numbers
- Stabilizing buffers and stocks
- Structure of flows and circuitry

**Relational plane interventions:**

- Negative feedback loop strength
- Positive feedback loop regulation
- Information flow networks

**Existential plane interventions:**

- Social rules and constraints
- Self-organization capacity
- System goals
- Paradigms and worldviews[^1]


### Diagnosis of Contemporary Society

Schwarz critiques the technological progress of modern society against its ecological, social, and economic problems. He observes that advances concentrate in manipulating inorganic materials through reductionist approaches, while problems concentrate in complex interdependent domains (ecology, economy, sociology) requiring holistic treatment. He argues that contemporary crises reflect the inadequacy of the mechanist paradigm and dualist epistemology for addressing complex systems.[^1]

### Anticipating Systems and Future Scenarios

In his work on anticipating systems, Schwarz applies his metamodel to contemporary society, contextualizing the empirico-rationalist paradigm that emerged during the Renaissance. He proposes three families of scenarios for society's future:[^1]

1. **Regression**: Return to past value systems
2. **Continuation**: Persistence of utilitarian objectivism
3. **Metamorphosis**: Transition to integrated value systems

He integrates Clare Graves' eight-level value systems typology to articulate these scenarios more concretely.[^1]

### Key Epistemological Innovations

Unlike mechanist science which treats relations as material particles (gravitons, photons), Schwarz's framework recognizes relations as **immaterial networks of potential causation immanent in material structures**. This distinction proves critical for understanding complex, autonomous systems where equations themselves change with system evolution—contrasting with astronomy where invariant equations suffice.[^1]

His approach challenges reductionism by asserting that holistic properties emerge from collective cooperative effects that cannot be understood from components alone. Life, consciousness, and autonomy exemplify such emergent properties dependent on both structural complexity and logical organization.[^1]

### Theoretical Influences and Synthesis

Schwarz synthesized three crucial traditions:[^1]

- **General Systems Theory** (Ludwig von Bertalanffy): Understanding systems as indivisible wholes with emergent properties
- **Cybernetics** (Norbert Wiener, Heinz von Foerster): Circular causal relations and self-reference
- **Autopoiesis** (Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela): Logic of self-productive living systems


### Practical Applications

The metamodel addresses real-world complexity across multiple domains. It provides frameworks for understanding ecological systems, social transformations, organizational change, and cognitive development. By identifying system leverage points and understanding viable system dynamics, managers and policymakers can intervene more effectively without triggering unintended consequences.[^1]

### Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

Though Eric Schwarz passed away in March 2015, his holistic cybernetics framework remains relevant to contemporary challenges including climate change, technological disruption, and social fragmentation. His emphasis on understanding systems as wholes rather than collections of parts aligns with emerging interdisciplinary research in complexity science, sustainability, and systemic thinking.[^1]

The document collection compiled by Maurice Yolles preserves Schwarz's intellectual contributions for accessibility, ensuring his pioneering work in third-order cybernetics continues informing systems science, organizational development, and philosophical inquiry into the nature of complex adaptive systems.[^1]
