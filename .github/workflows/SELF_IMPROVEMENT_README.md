# AI-Powered Self-Improvement Workflow

## Overview

The `self-improvement.yml` workflow is an enhanced, AI-powered version of the `self-maintenance.yml` template that uses intelligent analysis and dynamic adaptation to generate targeted micro-improvements.

## Key Differences from self-maintenance.yml

### 1. **AI-Powered Assessment**
- **Original**: Static build checks with hardcoded success messages
- **New**: Intelligent build assessment that captures and analyzes build logs in real-time
- **Enhancement**: Uses environment variables to track build status (PASSED, BUILD_FAILED, CMAKE_FAILED)

### 2. **Dynamic Micro-Improvement Generation**
- **Original**: Static improvement plan with fixed checklist items
- **New**: Python-based AI inference that analyzes current state and generates context-specific improvements
- **Enhancement**: BuildAnalyzer class that uses pattern matching and log analysis to identify specific issues

### 3. **Pattern Recognition**
The AI system recognizes multiple error patterns:
- Missing dependencies (`Could not find`, `No package`, `not found`)
- Compilation errors (`error:`, `fatal error:`, `compilation terminated`)
- Linking errors (`undefined reference`, `cannot find -l`)
- Configuration errors (`CMake Error`, `configuration failed`)

### 4. **Priority-Based Improvements**
- **Original**: All improvements treated equally
- **New**: Three-tier priority system (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - HIGH: CMake failures, missing dependencies, build failures
  - MEDIUM: Large numbers of compiler warnings (>10)
  - LOW: Optimization opportunities for passing builds

### 5. **Component-Specific Micro-Tasks**
Each improvement includes:
- Priority level
- Affected component
- Issue description
- Recommended action
- Detailed micro-tasks checklist

### 6. **Intelligent Report Generation**
The AI-generated report includes:
- Current state assessment with status table
- Categorized micro-improvements by priority
- Cognitive synergy metrics (component integration percentage)
- Build health assessment (Excellent/Good/Fair/Needs Improvement)
- AI confidence level
- Top 5 recommended next steps

### 7. **Automated Implementation**
- **Original**: Manual implementation of improvements
- **New**: `dynamic-improvement-implementation` job that automatically applies fixes for HIGH priority issues
- **Enhancement**: Conditional execution based on build health status

### 8. **Continuous Learning Cycle**
- **Original**: Static improvement plan
- **New**: Learning report that documents patterns and insights
- **Enhancement**: Feedback loop for improving future recommendations

## Workflow Jobs

### Job 1: ai-assessment
**Purpose**: Intelligent analysis of all cognitive components

**Steps**:
1. Checkout code with submodules
2. Setup build environment
3. Install Python and AI libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn)
4. Run intelligent build assessment for all components
5. Execute AI-powered analysis with BuildAnalyzer
6. Generate comprehensive improvement report
7. Upload artifacts (reports and logs)

**Outputs**:
- `build_status`: HEALTHY or DEGRADED
- `improvement_priority`: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW

### Job 2: dynamic-improvement-implementation
**Purpose**: Apply AI-recommended improvements

**Steps**:
1. Download AI analysis artifacts
2. Parse improvements.json
3. Apply automated micro-improvements for HIGH priority items
4. Generate implementation summary

**Trigger**: Only runs if build status is not HEALTHY

### Job 3: continuous-learning
**Purpose**: Document patterns and insights

**Steps**:
1. Download all reports
2. Generate learning report
3. Document AGI progress metrics
4. Upload comprehensive learning report

**Trigger**: Always runs (even if previous jobs fail)

## AI Inference Capabilities

### BuildAnalyzer Class
The core AI component that provides:

1. **Log Analysis**: Scans build logs for error patterns
2. **Insight Extraction**: Categorizes errors and warnings
3. **Improvement Generation**: Creates targeted micro-tasks based on detected issues
4. **Metrics Calculation**: Computes cognitive synergy and build health scores
5. **Report Generation**: Produces markdown reports with actionable recommendations

### Example Output Structure

```json
{
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "component": "CogGML",
  "issue": "CMake configuration failure",
  "action": "Review CMakeLists.txt in coggml directory",
  "micro_tasks": [
    "Check CMake minimum version requirements",
    "Verify all required dependencies are listed",
    "Add more informative error messages to CMake scripts",
    "Consider adding FindPackage modules for dependencies"
  ]
}
```

## Cognitive Synergy Metrics

The workflow calculates and reports:

1. **Component Integration**: Percentage of components passing builds
2. **Build Health**: Qualitative assessment (Excellent/Good/Fair/Needs Improvement)
3. **AI Confidence**: Based on build success rate
4. **Self-Assessment**: Tracking of autonomous capabilities
5. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Status of improvement mechanisms
6. **Pattern Learning**: Operational status
7. **Autonomous Improvement**: Progress tracking

## Schedule

- **Trigger**: Daily at 3 AM UTC (1 hour after self-maintenance.yml)
- **Also runs on**: Push to main, pull requests, manual dispatch
- **Purpose**: Continuous improvement cycle with fresh analysis

## Benefits Over Original Template

1. **Adaptive**: Responds to actual build state rather than static assumptions
2. **Intelligent**: Uses pattern recognition to identify specific issues
3. **Actionable**: Generates concrete micro-tasks based on real problems
4. **Automated**: Can apply fixes automatically for known issues
5. **Learning**: Improves over time by documenting patterns
6. **Prioritized**: Focuses effort on most critical issues first
7. **Measurable**: Tracks cognitive synergy and build health metrics
8. **Comprehensive**: Provides detailed analysis with logs and structured data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the AI system:
1. Integration with actual LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) for more sophisticated analysis
2. Machine learning model to predict build failures before they occur
3. Automated pull request generation for fixes
4. Historical trend analysis across multiple runs
5. Component dependency graph analysis
6. Performance benchmarking and optimization suggestions
7. Integration with issue tracking for automated issue creation
8. Slack/Discord notifications for critical improvements

## Usage

The workflow runs automatically, but can also be triggered manually:

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run self-improvement.yml

# Via GitHub web interface
Actions → AI-Powered Self-Improvement → Run workflow
```

## Artifacts Generated

Each run produces:
1. `ai-improvement-report` - Main analysis report and improvements.json
2. `improvement-implementation-summary` - Summary of applied fixes
3. `continuous-learning-report` - Learning insights and AGI metrics
4. Build logs for all components

## Dependencies

Required packages installed during workflow:
- cmake
- build-essential
- python3
- python3-pip
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Integration with Existing Workflows

This workflow complements `self-maintenance.yml`:
- **self-maintenance.yml**: Runs at 2 AM UTC, performs basic maintenance
- **self-improvement.yml**: Runs at 3 AM UTC, analyzes results and generates improvements

Together they form a complete autonomous improvement cycle.
