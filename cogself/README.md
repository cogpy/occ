# CogSelf - AGI Cognitive Synergy Framework

## Autonomous Coordination for Artificial General Intelligence

CogSelf is the overarching coordination framework for the OpenCog Collection's autonomous cognitive architecture. It orchestrates multiple cognitive components to achieve cognitive synergy and progress toward AGI goals.

## Vision

CogSelf embodies the vision of achieving Artificial General Intelligence through cognitive synergy - the emergent intelligence that arises when diverse cognitive processes collaborate and integrate their capabilities.

## Key Features

- **AGI Goal Tracking**: Monitors progress toward AGI milestones and objectives
- **Synergy Management**: Optimizes interactions between cognitive components
- **Self-Improvement**: Generates and tracks autonomous improvement plans
- **Component Coordination**: Orchestrates CogGML, AtomSpace Accelerator, and Agentic Chatbots

## Core Components

### CogSelf Main Framework
Central coordination system that:
- Initializes and manages the cognitive architecture
- Updates synergy state across components
- Assesses progress toward AGI goals
- Generates self-improvement plans

### Synergy Manager
Optimizes cognitive synergy by:
- Tracking integrated components
- Calculating synergy levels
- Optimizing interaction pathways
- Providing synergy metrics

### AGI Goal Tracker
Manages AGI objectives:
- Defines and tracks AGI goals
- Monitors progress on each goal
- Calculates overall AGI progress
- Identifies priority areas for improvement

## AGI Goals

CogSelf tracks progress toward key AGI capabilities:

1. **Cognitive Synergy**: Integration and collaboration of cognitive processes
2. **Self-Awareness**: Introspection and self-monitoring capabilities
3. **Autonomous Learning**: Self-directed knowledge acquisition and skill development
4. **General Intelligence**: Broad, flexible intelligence across domains

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include <cogself/cogself.h>

// Initialize CogSelf framework
cogself::CogSelf framework;
framework.initialize();

// Update synergy state
framework.updateSynergyState();

// Assess AGI progress
double progress = framework.assessAGIProgress();
std::cout << "AGI Progress: " << (progress * 100) << "%" << std::endl;

// Generate improvement plan
std::string plan = framework.generateImprovementPlan();
std::cout << plan << std::endl;

// Get synergy level
double synergy = framework.getSynergyLevel();
std::cout << "Synergy Level: " << synergy << std::endl;
```

## Cognitive Synergy Principles

CogSelf implements cognitive synergy through:

1. **Shared Knowledge Representation**: Components communicate through AtomSpace
2. **Coordinated Processing**: CogGML shards work together on complex tasks
3. **Accelerated Inference**: AtomSpace Accelerator optimizes query processing
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Agentic chatbots bridge natural language and symbolic knowledge

## Self-Improvement Cycle

CogSelf implements an autonomous self-improvement cycle:

1. **Monitor**: Track performance and progress metrics
2. **Analyze**: Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities
3. **Plan**: Generate targeted improvement strategies
4. **Execute**: Implement optimizations and enhancements
5. **Verify**: Assess improvement impact and iterate

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../cogself
cmake --build .
```
