- ‚úÖ I/O: 75% (Excellent)
- ‚úÖ Knowledge Representation: 100% (Unique to AGI)
- ‚úÖ Learning Systems: 100% (Complete)

**Critical Gaps**:
- ‚ùå Security: 25% (CRITICAL - No privilege separation)
- ‚ùå Interrupts: 20% (HIGH - Missing event bus)
- üü° Scheduling: 40% (HIGH - No priorities)

**Timeline to Production**: 18-24 months
