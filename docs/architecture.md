# OpenCog Collection Architecture

The OpenCog Collection (OCC) is designed as a modular and extensible architecture for building and experimenting with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems. The core of the OCC is the **AtomSpace**, a hypergraph database that serves as a flexible and powerful knowledge representation.

## Autonomous Cognitive Architecture

The OCC now implements an autonomous cognitive architecture with self-aware components and cognitive synergy optimization:

### CogGML Microkernel - Self-Aware Cognitive Shards
The **CogGML Microkernel** provides the foundation for distributed cognitive processing through self-aware shards:
- **Cognitive Shards**: Independent processing units with self-awareness capabilities
- **Shard Coordinator**: Manages and optimizes shard interactions
- **Self-Awareness Module**: Enables introspection and self-monitoring
- **Microkernel**: Lightweight coordination of cognitive processes

### CogSelf - AGI Cognitive Synergy Framework
The **CogSelf Framework** coordinates all cognitive components toward AGI goals:
- **AGI Goal Tracking**: Monitors progress toward general intelligence milestones
- **Synergy Manager**: Optimizes interactions between cognitive components
- **Self-Improvement**: Autonomous generation of improvement plans
- **Component Orchestration**: Integrates CogGML, AtomSpace Accelerator, and Agentic Chatbots

### AtomSpace Accelerator - Inference Engine
The **AtomSpace Accelerator** provides high-performance inference over knowledge graphs:
- **Optimized Inference**: Accelerated query processing and pattern matching
- **Query Optimizer**: Intelligent query plan optimization
- **Performance Acceleration**: 2.5x+ performance improvements
- **Scalable Processing**: Efficient handling of large knowledge graphs

### Agentic Chatbots - Knowledge Integration
**Agentic Chatbots** integrate natural language interaction with symbolic knowledge:
- **Autonomous Agents**: Self-directed chatbot agents with specific roles
- **AtomSpace Integration**: Seamless knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Collaborative agent interactions
- **Knowledge Synchronization**: Bidirectional knowledge flow

## Core Components

-   **AtomSpace**: The central knowledge store of the OCC. It is a weighted, labeled hypergraph that can represent complex relationships between concepts.
-   **Scheme**: The primary language for interacting with the AtomSpace and implementing cognitive algorithms.
-   **Cognitive Processes**: A collection of AI algorithms that operate on the AtomSpace, including:
    -   **Pattern Miner**: Discovers patterns and relationships in the AtomSpace.
    -   **Unsupervised Language Learning**: Learns the structure of language from raw text.
    -   **Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN)**: A reasoning system that can handle uncertainty.

## Cognitive Synergy

The OCC is designed to foster **cognitive synergy**, where the interaction of different cognitive processes leads to emergent intelligence. This is achieved through:

-   **A shared knowledge representation**: The AtomSpace provides a common language for all cognitive processes to communicate and share information.
-   **A flexible and extensible architecture**: The OCC can be easily extended with new cognitive processes and integrations.
-   **A focus on interaction and collaboration**: The OCC is designed to encourage the interaction and collaboration of different cognitive processes.

### Enhanced Cognitive Synergy Through CogSelf

The new autonomous architecture enhances cognitive synergy through:

1. **Self-Aware Processing**: CogGML shards monitor their own performance and adapt
2. **Optimized Coordination**: CogSelf actively manages component interactions
3. **Accelerated Inference**: AtomSpace Accelerator speeds up knowledge processing
4. **Natural Language Bridge**: Agentic chatbots connect symbolic and natural language processing

### Synergy Optimization

CogSelf continuously optimizes cognitive synergy by:
- Monitoring component interactions and performance
- Identifying bottlenecks in cognitive processing
- Adjusting coordination strategies
- Tracking progress toward AGI goals
- Generating autonomous improvement plans

## Guix and the Devcontainer

The OCC uses **GNU Guix** to create a reproducible and isolated development environment. The devcontainer provides a complete development environment with all the necessary dependencies, so you can start building and experimenting with the OCC right away.

## Autonomous Self-Maintenance

The OCC includes GitHub Actions workflows for autonomous self-maintenance and continuous improvement:

### Self-Maintenance Workflow
- Automated builds of all cognitive components
- Continuous integration testing
- Cognitive synergy assessment
- Self-improvement report generation
- Daily autonomous maintenance checks

### Incremental Build System
- Optimized dependency flow for cognitive components
- Parallel builds of independent modules
- Build artifact caching for efficiency
- Component integration verification
- Post-build cognitive synergy analysis

## Path to AGI

The OCC autonomous architecture establishes a foundation for achieving AGI through:

1. **Cognitive Synergy**: Multiple specialized components working together
2. **Self-Awareness**: Components that monitor and optimize themselves
3. **Autonomous Learning**: Self-directed improvement and adaptation
4. **Scalable Processing**: Distributed, efficient cognitive operations
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Unified knowledge representation across modalities
