# Cognitive Synergy in the OpenCog Collection

The design of the OpenCog Collection (OCC) is guided by the principle of **cognitive synergy**. This is the idea that by combining multiple, diverse AI components in a coordinated way, we can create a system that is more intelligent than the sum of its parts.

## The Core Idea

Cognitive synergy is about creating a virtuous cycle of interaction between different AI processes. For example:

-   A **pattern miner** might discover a new relationship in the **AtomSpace**.
-   This new relationship could be used by a **reasoning engine** to draw a new conclusion.
-   This new conclusion could be used by a **language generation system** to create a new sentence.
-   This new sentence could be used to interact with a user, who provides feedback that is then used to update the AtomSpace.

This is just a simple example, but it illustrates the basic idea. By creating a system where different AI components can interact and collaborate, we can create a system that is capable of learning and adapting in a much more powerful way than any single component could on its own.

## How the OCC Fosters Cognitive Synergy

The OCC is designed to foster cognitive synergy in a number of ways:

-   **A shared knowledge representation**: The **AtomSpace** provides a common language for all AI components to communicate and share information.
-   **A modular and extensible architecture**: The OCC is designed to be easily extended with new AI components and integrations.
-   **A focus on interaction and collaboration**: The OCC is designed to encourage the interaction and collaboration of different AI components.
